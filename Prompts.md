Solve:

Read CLAUDE.md and solve the Problem using the Proposed Solution. Create a new
   solution.md file following the exact format of solutionExample.md.

   - Apply repository information and guidelines from CLAUDE.md                  
   - Use the same structure, headers, and format as solutionExample.md           
   - Ensure Windows compatibility                                                
   - Focus on implementing the core solution effectively                         
                                                                                 
   **Process:**                                                                  
   1. Extract key context from CLAUDE.md                                         
   2. Implement the proposed solution approach                                   
   3. Document in solution.md using the established template format              
                                                                                 
   The solution should be complete, technically sound, and formatted consistently
   with the example template.
